## Rules

1. Code must be in publicly visible repositories on GitHub. If you want to
   make a private repository, you must make a special request and make a case
   for why you want it be private.

   You must submit all repositories you are working on to the organisers so
   that we can collect and show what people are working on.

2. You may either work individually or as a team. Teams are preferred.

3. Only new code is evaluated.

   If you have an existing project that you are working on, you can continue
   working on that, but only commits made after November 1st, 2014
   00:00:00-0500 are counted towards judging.

4. You must attend the kickoff event and each of the checkins to participate.
   Programming is about more than sitting alone hunched over a keyboard.

5. We have high standards for code. No hacks here. We want tests and
   documentation. Write code as if you will be coming back to it in a year. Who
   knows, you might at the next Mo' Code Movember. Take pride in your craft.

5. You don't have to work on a single project throughout Mo' Code Movember. If
   you want to work on Mo' Problems, Mo' Power to you. However, this is not an
   excuse to drop your standards.

## Judging:

- The Writer: best commit messages, documentation, blogging, etc.

  The Writer tells you why they are doing things, not just what they are doing.

- The Engineer: best use of reusable components.

  The Engineer doesn't reinvent the wheel. Instead, the Engineer stands on the
  shoulders of giants.

- The Mechanic: best use of hardware hacking. If you're interfacing over
  serial, bit banging, or spinning servos, you are in the running for this.

  The Mechanic isn't afraid to get their hands dirty and solder some circuits.

- The Invigilator: best use of tests.

  The Invigilator is no-nonsense when it comes to code coverage. Positive
  tests, negative tests, data driven, test-first: the Invigilator does them
  all.
  
- The Bicycle Repair Man: patches to FOSS code.

  The Bicycle Repair Man is an FOSS hero that sends well-tested patches
  to FOSS projects. These projects can even be ones that are

- The Community Leader: greases the cogs of FOSS.

  The Community Leader encourages others to improve their code, suggests other
  ways to program, provides support to new developers and users, etc.

- The Rockstar: devops automation

  The Rockstar makes sure that projects have a good ecosystem to work in. This
  includes build automation, continuous integration, automated installation,
  virtual machines, etc.

- The Polyglot: speaks many languages

  The Polyglot doesn't care which language they are using as long as it gets
  the job done.
